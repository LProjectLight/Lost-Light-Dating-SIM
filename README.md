# Features in this game!

This game has many features and are as followed. 

- If you choose a route of a character, you are not stuck using that character, you can always woo other canadites. 
- If you didn't choose certain canadites they will end up together (Such as Cyclonus and Tailgate and Rung and Mal).
- There will be events! Unlike CGs these events are tallied up whenever you get a certain star event! Just like Harvest Moon these icons determine what the bots think of you! Like for instance, if you have a pink star that means its the highest love you'll get. Alongside this there will be rival events. Like for instance, you start off with a grey star. The grey star is the lower star, and upon arriving in certain areas you will see an event between characters. (Rung with Mal, Whirl with Ultra Magnus, Rodimus with Nautica, Cyclonus with Tailgate and Swerve with Skids), these events will continue if you don't persue a relationship with either of them. The starts of the rival start event will start when you don't persue the relationship with the canidate. 
- Custom soundtrack made by me! 
- Marriage will happen! 
- Very cute Cgs!
- Ingame clock!
